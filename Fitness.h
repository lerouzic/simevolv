/* Trivial tool to expand incomplete vectors. Here is the summary of the problem:
   For simplicity, a vector can be specific in the parameter file
   as a single number. In this case, all members of the vector would be considered as 
   identical. 
   Fitness strengths and optima are in such a situation. The problem is that there is 
   no easy way to know the size of the vector before the fitness functions are called in
   a real context. So, when the different fitness classes are initialized, vectors are stored
   as provided by the parameter set (either vectors or scalars). When used for the first time, 
   the size is compared to the dimensionality of phenotypes, and adjusted there -- this function
   is used for that purpose. 
   Obviously, this is not very elegant, but there is no reason that it shoudn't work. */
